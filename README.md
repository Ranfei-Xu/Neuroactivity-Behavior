# Neuroactivity-Behavior

Analyzed neuron activity patterns and corresponding mouse behavior in the Zero Maze experiment using time series data. 

Applied various models (Logistic Regression, Simple Neural Network Model, RNN with time lags, LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM) to establish relationships and found bidirectional LSTM as the optimal model. 

Tested model stability and displayed predicted accuracy via ROC curve and Confusion Matrix. 

Contributed to understanding neural mechanisms underlying animal behavior.
